There exist several logical constructions of limits of classes of finite structures such as the ultraproduct construction or using the compactness theorem. The latter used in \cite{Fagin1976} to prove the 0-1 law for structures over relational vocabularies.

In combinatorics there are also several notions of limits of finite graphs. For example the dense graph limit defined for a sequence of graph $\{G_k\}_{k>0}$ satisfying the condition that
\[t(F,G_n)=\frac{\hom(F,G)}{\abs{G_n}^{\abs{F}}}\]
converges for every fixed connected graph $F$ which provided a framework (see \cite{lovasz2006limits}) to restate and find new proofs for results in extremal graph theory such as Goodman's theorem relating the number of edges to the number of triangles in a graph. There are other notions of limits of sequences of graphs we recommend to read \cite{Nesetril2013} to the interested reader. Another recent use of limit objects for the results of extremal combinatorics was by Razborov in \cite{razborov2007flag}.

These diferent notions of limits directly or tangentially relate to the concept of pseudofinite structures. For a first order language $L$, we call an $L$-structure $S$ pseudofinite, if it satisfies the theory $T_f$ consisting of all sentences true in all finite $L$-structures.

In this thesis we use the concept of pseudofinite structures to define a limit of a family of finite graphs relative to some computationally restricted class of functions $F$. Instead of studying the density of substructures we study these so called wide limits both generally and by analyzing concrete examples and tying them with complexity-theoretical statements. Imagine to keep in mind is that we take a limit of a class of inputs to a specific problem and let the limit `look' like some computationally restricted viewer may see the average input.

The key method we use is arithmetical forcing with random variables which allows us to construct models of (weak) arithmetical theories and by restricting to a language of graphs gives us boolean valued graphs. An important resource for this technique is \cite{krajicek2010forcing}. In these boolean valued graphs, witnessing of existential quantifiers corresponds to the ability of $F$ to solve search problems over the class of graphs we are considering.

After recalling important concepts in the Preliminaries chapter we define the wide limit in Chapter \ref{chapwidelimit}. In Chapter \ref{chapgeneraltheory} we consider some examples and around them build a general theory. In chapters \ref{chapdense} and \ref{chapsparse} we analyze more complex examples which correspond to the complexity of finding a large clique and to semantic subclasses of $\TFNP$ respectively.
