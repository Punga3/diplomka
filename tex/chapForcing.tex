\chapter{Forcing with random variables and the wide Limit}\label{chapwidelimit}
\section{Setup}

Our goal in this chapter is to provide a definition of a limit of a set an infinite set of finite graphs in which arbitrarily large graphs occur. The following definition makes our requirements of such a class of graphs precise. From now on $E$ denotes a binary relational symbol, so formulas in the theory of graphs are $E$-sentences.

\begin{defi}
Let $\{\mathcal{G}_k\}_{k>0}$ be a sequence of finite sets of (directed or undirected) finite graphs. We call it a \textbf{wide sequence} if the following hold.

\begin{itemize}
\item There is an increasing sequence of positive whole numbers $\{g_k\}_{k>0}$ such that the underlying set of each $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$ is $\set{g_k}$.
\item $\lim_{k\to\infty} \abs{\mathcal{G}_k}=\infty$
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

The second condition guarantees that $\mathcal{G}_n$ is an infinite set for $n>\mathbb{N}$. In fact the condition is not strictly important to proceed with this chapter, but it more closely describes what sort of sequences we are interested in. Many interesting classes of graphs form a wide sequence if we restrict the vertex-sets to $\set{g_k}$, where $\{g_k\}_{k>0}$ can be taken as the increasing sequence of all cardinalities in such a class. For example graphs with exactly one edge, graphs with bounded degree and so on, we will get to explore many examples in depth after we define the wide limit.

\section{The first order wide limit}

From now on we closely follow Chapter 1 of \cite{krajicek2010forcing}. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the $\aleph_1$-saturated model of true arithmetic discussed in the previous chapter and let $\mathcal{G}_k$ be a wide sequence of graphs and $\Omega:=\mathcal{G}_n$ for $n\in\mathcal{M}\setminus \mathbb{N}$. One can check that graphs in $\Omega$ are all pseudofinite. The model $\M$ treats all its elements (including those which represent sets) as ``finite objects'' which lets us define uniform probability even on sets which are infinite from the set-theoretical perspective. We provide the definition generally for any $L$-reduct of $\M$, where $L\subseteq L_{all}$, but in the rest of the thesis we assume $L=L_{all}$ even though some finite sublanguage would suffice.


\begin{defi}
Let $\mathcal{A}:=\{A\in\mathcal{M};A\subseteq \Omega\}$ be the set of all subsets of $\Omega$ represented by an element in $\M$.

We define the \textbf{counting measure} as the uniform probability of $A$ when we sample $\Omega$ uniformly, so we have
\[A\in\A \to \abs{A}/\abs{\Omega},\]
the counting measure takes values in $\M$-rationals.
\end{defi}

One can check that $\A$ is a boolean algebra, but not a $\sigma$-algebra as it is not closed under all countable unions. Indeed all singleton sets are part of $\A$ but the set of all elements with standardly many predecessors in $\Omega$ is not in $\A$.

\begin{defi}
We call an $\M$-rational \textbf{infinitesimal} if it is smaller than all standard fractions $\frac{1}{k},k\in\N$.

Define an ideal in $\A$ as $\I:=\{A\in\A;\abs{A}/\abs{\Omega}\text{ is infinitesimal}\}$. Define the boolean algebra $\B:=\A/\I$. The induced measure on $\B$ is a real-valued measure and can be written as \[\mu(A/\I)=\st(\abs{A}/\abs{\Omega}).\]
\end{defi}

We can also check, that now $\mu$ is a measure in the ordinary sense and that $\B$ is an $\sigma$-algebra. In fact the following key lemma holds.

\begin{lemm}
$\B$ is a complete boolean algebra.
\end{lemm}

We now define what we require of the family of functions $F$ we already mentioned.

\begin{defi}
Let $L\subseteq L_{all}$ and let $F$ be a non-empty set of functions in $\M$. We call it an \textbf{$L$-closed family} if it satisfies the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain of any function in $F$ is $\Omega$ and the range is $\M$.
\item $F$ is closed under all $L$-functions and contains all $L$ constants, where the $L$-functions are interpreted by composition
\[f(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)(\omega):=f(\alpha_1(\omega),\dots,\alpha_k(\omega)),\]
for $k\in\N$, $f\in L$ $k$-ary and $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k\in F$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

Now we can finally define the wide limit and its underlying arithmetic. We will touch on the arithmetic in Section \ref{secpDPATH} and as we only consider the wide limit itself in Chapter \ref{chapgeneraltheory}.

Note that while every $\alpha\in F$ is represented by some element in $\M$ this need not be the case for the whole family $F$. From now on $\Gamma$ denotes a binary relational symbol which we understand as `limit edge relation'. For a $\{E\}$-formula $\varphi$ we denote its translation to a $\{\Gamma\}$-formula by rewriting every $E$ to $\Gamma$ as $\varphi^{\Gamma}$.

\begin{defi}
We call a function $\alpha\in F$ an $F$-vertex if ${\alpha:\Omega\to\set{g_n}}.$ We define a $\B$-valued graph $\lim_{k\to n}^{F}G_k$ as an $\{\Gamma\}$-structure, where $\Gamma$ is a binary relation symbol, with universe $\{\alpha\in F; \alpha\text{ is an $F$-vertex}\}$ and $\Gamma$-sentences being evaluated by the following inductive conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bbl \alpha=\beta \bbr := \{\omega\in\Omega; \alpha(\omega)=\beta(\omega)\}/\I.$
\item $\bbl \Gamma(\alpha,\beta) \bbr := \{\omega\in\Omega; E_G(\alpha,\beta))\}/\I$.
\item $\bbl-\bbr$ commutes with $\land$,$\lor$,$\lnot$.
\item $\bbl(\exists x)A(x)\bbr:=\Lor_{\alpha\in F}\bbl A(\alpha)\bbr$.
\item $\bbl(\forall x)A(x)\bbr:=\Land_{\alpha\in F}\bbl A(\alpha)\bbr$.
\end{itemize}

By abuse of notation we will usually denote the limit $\lim_{F}\G_n$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
Let $F$ be an $L$-closed family for some $L\subseteq L_{all}$. Then $K(\G_n,F)$ will denote a $\B$-valued $L\cup\{\Gamma\}$-structure defined as follows. The universe of $K(F)$ is $F$. The boolean evaluations of $L$-sentences are defined by the following inductive rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\bbl \alpha=\beta \bbr := \{\omega\in\Omega; \alpha(\omega)=\beta(\omega)\}/\I.$
\item $\bbl R(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k) \bbr := \{\omega\in\Omega; R(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)\}/\I$ for any $k$-ary $L$-relation $R$.
\item $\bbl \Gamma(\alpha,\beta) \bbr := \{\omega\in\Omega; E_G(\alpha(\omega),\beta(\omega))\text{ and }\alpha(\omega),\beta(\omega)\in\set{g_n})\}/\I$.
\item $\bbl-\bbr$ commutes with $\land$,$\lor$,$\lnot$.
\item $\bbl(\exists x)A(x)\bbr:=\Lor_{\alpha\in F}\bbl A(\alpha)\bbr$.
\item $\bbl(\forall x)A(x)\bbr:=\Land_{\alpha\in F}\bbl A(\alpha)\bbr$.
\end{itemize}

We call $F(\G_n,F)$ the \textbf{underlying arithmetic of the first order wide limit}.
\end{defi}


\section{The second order wide limit}

While we can find a truth value of a sentence in the language of graphs in the limit $\lim_{F}\G_n$, we will encounter situations where this is not sufficient to analyze the wide sequence $\{\G_k\}_{k>0}$. 

In Chapter \ref{chapdense} we will investigate how does existence of large cliques correspond to the size of cliques in the limit graph. First we need some way to witness subsets of vertices -- this leads us to the second order wide limit. For it however the underlying arithmetic is much more important because we cannot just measure the set-theoretical cardinality of any such clique, for specific $n$ we could very well have $\card(\set{\floor{\log{n}}})=\card(\set{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}})$ but from the point of view of complexity theory cliques of size $\floor{\log n}$ and $\floor{\frac{n}{2}}$ are dramatically different. In other words, our goal is also to have means to count the number elements of subsets or relations with values in (random variables in) $\M$.

When we say second order we mean by it two-sorted first order structures where one sort represents the usual elements (the `first order' sort) and the other represents functions on those elements (the `second order' sort). The `second order' here can also represent sets and relations by \{0,1\} valued functions.

\begin{defi}
Let $L\subseteq L_{all}$, we call a set of functions $G\subseteq \M$ an $F$-closed \textbf{functional family} if every $\Theta\in G$ assigns to every $\omega\in\Omega$ a function $\Theta_\omega\in\M$ and after we define
\[\Theta(\alpha)(\omega):=
\begin{cases}\Theta_\omega(\alpha(\omega))&\alpha(\omega)\in\dom(\Theta_\omega)\\0&\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}\]
we have that for every $\alpha \in F$ and $\Theta \in G$ we have $\Theta(\alpha)\in F$.

We call $\Theta\in G$ a (graph) $G$-\textbf{relation} if for every $\omega\in\Omega$ we have for some $k>0$ that $\dom \Theta_\omega \supseteq \set{g_n}^k$ and $\Theta_\omega:\dom \Theta_\omega \to \{0,1\}$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
Let $L\subseteq L_{all}$, $F$ an $L$-closed family and $G$ an $F$-compatible functional family. We define the structure $K(\G_n,F,G)$ as a two sorted $L$-structure with sorts $F$ and $G$ interpreting $L$-sentences as $K(\G_n,F)$ and treating the sort $G$ as follows. First for equality we let
\[\bbl\Theta=\Xi \bbr := \{\omega\in \Omega;\Theta_\omega=\Xi_\omega\}/\I\]
and for the second order quantifiers we have the following inductive clauses
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bbl(\exists X)A(X)\bbr:=\Lor_{\Theta\in G}\bbl A(\Theta)\bbr$
\item $\bbl(\forall X)A(X)\bbr:=\Land_{\Theta\in G}\bbl A(\Theta)\bbr.$
\end{itemize}

If there is a $\Gamma\in G$ such that for every $\alpha,\beta\in F$ we have
\[\Gamma(\alpha,\beta)(\omega):=\chi_{E_\omega}(\alpha(\omega),\beta(\omega)),\]
where $\chi_{E_\omega}$ is the characteristic function of $E_\omega$, we call $K(F,G)$ the \textbf{underlying arithmetic of the second order wide limit}.

We define \textbf{the second order wide limit} $\lim_{F,n}^G\{\G_k\}_{k>0}$ as the two sorted substructure with universe consisting of all $F$-vertices and all $G$-relations. By abuse of notation we will mostly use the notation $\lim_F^G\G_n$.
\end{defi}

Let us note that if we have multiple boolean valued structures $\M_1,\M_2,\dots$ we may add the name of the structure as a prefix to the evaluation function to get $\M_1\bbl-\bbr$ and $\M_2\bbl-\bbr$ to avoid ambiguity or to emphasize the structure where the evaluation takes place.
 
\section{The $L$-closed family $F_{rud}$ and $G_{rud}$}\label{secFrud}

Throughout this thesis we will mostly work with the $L$-closed family $F_{rud}$ which ties the properties of $\lim_F \G_n$ with decision tree complexity -- but decision tress can be also seen as an abstraction of oracle machine time we mentioned in the Introduction.

After we choose the sequence $\{\G_k\}_{k>0}$ and $n>\N$ we again put $\Omega:=\G_n$ and define $F_{rud}$ as follows.

\begin{defi}
We define a \textbf{decision tree} to be a binary tree $T\in\M$ with a labelling of vertices and edges $\ell$. The non-leaf vertices are labeled by pairs of numbers $(u,v)$, where $u,v\in\set{g_n}$ and each edge is labeled either by $1$ or $0$. Each leaf vertex is then labeled by some element of $\M$.

Every sample $\omega\in\Omega$ uniquely determines a path in $(T,\ell)$ by interpreting the vertex labels as ``is $(u,v)\in E_\omega$?'' and the edge labels as true $(1)$ and false $(0)$ and the path then uniquely determines an output.

We define $F_{rud}$ to be the set of all functions computed by some $(T,\ell)$ of depth at most $g_n^{1/t}$.
\end{defi}

Note that if we are given a graph $G\in G_k$ on $g_k$ vertices, we need $l:=2\log g_n$ bits to represent it. In the pseudofinite case $k=n$ if we are restricted to inspect/query at most $g_n^{1/t}$ edges then it corresponds to $2^{O(l/t)}$ many queries or the subexponential oracle time.

One can verify that $F_{rud}$ is an $L$-closed family for any $L\subseteq L_{all}$.

The definition of $G_{rud}$ is a bit more involved. The functionals in it will be computed by tuples of elements from $F_{rud}$ in the following sense.

\begin{defi}
Let $\hat\beta=(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{m-1})\in\M$ be a $m$-tuple of elements in $F_{rud}$, for any $\alpha\in F_{rud}$ and $\omega\in\Omega$ we define
\[\hat\beta(\omega)=
\begin{cases}
\beta_{\alpha(\omega)}(\omega)&\alpha(\omega)<m\\
0&\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
The family $G_{rud}$ consists of all functionals $\Theta$ such that there is $m\in\M$ and some $\hat \beta=(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{m-1})$ that computes it.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemm}
$G_{rud}$ is $(F_{rud})$-compatible.
\end{lemm}
\begin{proof}
By induction in $\M$ we have that all the depth of all the trees is bounded by $g_n^{1/t}$ for some $t>\N$.

If we take some $\Theta\in G_{rud}$ and $\alpha\in F_{rud}$ we can compute $\Theta(\alpha)$ also by a tree in $F_{rud}$ by concatenating the trees computing $\alpha$ and $\beta_i$s.
\end{proof}

\section{Different choices of $n$}

Even though we generally pose no requirements on $n>\N$ there are examples of wide sequences for which the limit is sensitive on the choice of the non-standard number $n$.

\begin{exam}
Let 

\[\
G_{k}:=
\begin{cases}
\{(\set{k},E);\abs{E}=2,E(0,1)\}&\text{$k$ even}\\
\{(\set{k},E);\abs{E}=1,\lnot E(0,1)\}&\text{$k$ odd.}\\
\end{cases}\]

Let $n>\N$ then
\begin{align}
\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_{2n+1} \bbl \Gamma(0,1)\bbr =\0,
\end{align}
but
\begin{align}
\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_{2n}\bbl \Gamma(0,1)\bbr=\1.
\end{align}

Even though the concrete wide limits we will investigate in the following chapters do not depend on the specific $n$, it is important to note that we cannot generally remove the parameter $n$ from the definition of the limit.
\end{exam}

\section{Theories of wide limits}

If $\lim_F\G_n$ is the first order wide limit we will be interested in which exact $\{\Gamma\}$-sentences are valid in it.

\begin{defi}
We define $\Th(\lim_F\G_n)$ as the set of all valid $\Gamma$-sentences in $\lim_{F}\G_n$.
\end{defi}

In the next chapter (Theorem \ref{thrmuni}) we will see that if an universal $\{E\}$-sentence $\varphi$ holds for all $G\in\G_k$ for $k$ big enough then $\lim_F\G_n\bbl\varphi^\Gamma\bbr=\1$. In particular, a wide limit of undirected graphs in a boolean valued undirected graph and a wide limit of directed graphs is a boolean valued directed graph.

Lastly, let as recall the concept of 0-1 laws which say that a certain probability is always $0$ or always $1$ with no intermediate value. Here instead of probability we can think about the boolean values $\0$ and $\1$ and ask when does it happen that $\lim_F\G_n\bbl\varphi\bbr\in\{\0,\1\}$ for every $\{\Gamma\}$-sentence $\varphi$. This is exactly equivalent to the situation where the theory $\Th(\lim_G \G_n)$ is complete. Throughout the thesis we prove such 0-1 law for several wide limits.
