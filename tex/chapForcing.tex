\chapter{Forcing with random variables and the limit}
\section{Setup}

Our goal in this chapter is to provide a definition of a limit of a set an infinite set of finite graphs in which arbitrarily large graphs occur.

The following definition makes our requirements of such a class of graphs precise.

\begin{defi}
Let $\{\mathcal{G}_k\}_{k>0}$ be a sequence of finite sets of finite graphs. We call it a \textbf{wide sequence} if the following hold.

\begin{itemize}
\item There is an increasing sequence of positive whole numbers $\{g_k\}_{k>0}$ such that the underlying set of each $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$ is $\set{g_k}$.
\item $\lim_{k\to\infty} \abs{\mathcal{G}_k}=\infty$
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

The second condition guarantees that $\mathcal{G}_n$ is an infinite set for $n>\mathbb{N}$. Almost all interesting classes of graphs form a wide sequence if we restrict the vertex-sets to $\set{g_k}$.
