\section{$\mathcal{G}_k=\EDGE_k$}
We consider the classes of graphs
\[\EDGE_k:=\{\text{$(k,E); \abs{E}=1$}\},\]
and we let $\mathcal{G}_k=\EDGE_k$ and $F=F_{tree}$.

Intuitivelly one should not be able to find the edge on a significant i.e. non-infinitesimal fraction of samples with a tree that is allowed to explore only an infinitesimal fraction of edges.

\begin{thrm}\label{thrmedge}
We will prove that \[\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\Gamma(x,y)\bbr=\textbf{0}.\]
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
Let $T\in F_{tree}$ be a tree of depth $n^{1/t}$, for some $t>\mathbb{N}$ that outputs a pair of numbers less than $n$.

Start from the root of $T$ and always choose the path that corresponds to an edge not existing. At the end we obtain some answer, that gives us a set of at most $2 \cdot n^{1/t}+2$ vertices. Now we can find at least: 
\begin{align}
\binom{n-2n^{1/t}-2}{2}&=\frac{(n-2n^{1/t}-2)(n-2n^{1/t}-3)}{2}
\end{align}
different $\omega\in\Omega$ such that $T(\omega)$ is not an edge in $\omega$. 

The probability that any of those graphs is sampled is
\begin{align}
\frac{\binom{n-2n^{1/t}-2}{2}}{\abs{\mathcal{G}_k}}&=\frac{(n-2n^{1/t}-2)(n-2n^{1/t}-3)}{n(n-1)}\\
&=\left(1-\frac{2n^{1/t}-2}{n}\right)\cdot\left(1-\frac{2n^{1/t}-3}{n-1}\right)\\
&\geq \left(1-\frac{2n^{1/t}-2}{n}\right)^2\\
&\geq 1-\frac{4n^{1/t}-4}{n}.
\end{align}
And one can clearly see that $\st(1-\frac{4n^{1/t}-4}{n})=1$. This proves that the boolean value we are considering is $\textbf{0}$ since we can the two witnesses for $x$ and $y$ into a tree that could find an edge with depth $n^{1/t}$ for some $t>\mathbb{N}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Sparse $\mathcal{G}_k$}

One can see that in Theorem \ref{thrmedge} the exact shape of graphs in $\mathcal{G}_k$ does not play a crucial role. If $\mathcal{G}_k$ consisted of all graphs on $k$ verticies containing say exactly one triangle, or any other fixed subgraph of constant size, and no other edges, we would still find that the non-existence is valid in the limit graph.

A more general case would be to consider a family of graphs in which there is an infinitesimally small chance that two independent uniformly random verticies have an edge between. However, this is not sufficient.

\begin{exam}
Let $\mathcal{G}_k$ consist of those graphs on the vertex-set $k$ which contain the edge $E(0,1)$ and then has exactly one other edge. 

As $k$ increases, the number of edges get smaller than any standard positive fraction. But
\[\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)E(x,y)\bbr=\1,\]
as witnessed by $x$ being the constant $0$ and $y$ the constant $1$ both of which are computable by a tree of depth $0$.
\end{exam}

One can see that having distinguished verticies can ruin the sparseness implying the non-existence of edges in the limit graph. We want to distiguish from this situation by considering the sequences $\mathcal{G}_k$ satisfying the following natural definition.

\begin{defi}
We say that $\{\mathcal{G}_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is \textbf{isomorphism closed}, if there is $k_0$ such that for every $k>k_0$ if we have that $G_1\in\mathcal{G}_k$, $V_{G_2}=g_k$ and $G_1\cong G_2$ then $G_2\in\mathcal{G}_k$.
\end{defi}


\begin{thrm}\label{thrmsparse}
Let an isomorphism closed $\mathcal{G}_k$ have the following property. There is a sequence $\{b_k\}_{k}$ and for big enough $k$, a uniformly sampled $2$-element $\{u,v\}\subseteq g_k$ and every $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$ we have
\[\Pr[E_G(u,v)]\leq b_k,\]
and some $k_0$ such that $\lim_{k\to\infty}k^{1/k_0}b_k = 0.$ Then

\[\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\Gamma(x,y)\bbr=\0.\]
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
Let us define the number $c_{u,v}:=\abs{\{G\in\mathcal{G}_k; E_G(u,v)\}}$, which is the number of graphs $G$ in $\mathcal{G}_k$ satisfying $E_G(u,v)$. Of course $c_{u,u}=0$ for every $u$.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Claim:} Let $u\neq v,u'\neq v'$ be vertices, then $c_{u,v}=c_{u',v'}$.\\
\textit{proof of claim:} Let $\rho:=(u\:u')(v\:v')$ be a permutation with cycles $(u\:u')$ and $(v\:v')$. We can let $\rho$ act on $\mathcal{G}_k$ by sending $G$ to a graph $\rho(G)$ which renames the edges coordinate-wise.

The fact that $\mathcal{G}_k$ is isomorphism closed implies that $\rho$ restricts to a bijection:
\[\rho':\{G\in\mathcal{G}_k;E_G(u,v), \lnot E_G(u',v')\}\to \{G\in\mathcal{G}_k;E_G(u',v'),\lnot E_G(u,v)\}\]
which proves the claim. \qed
\vspace{0.5em}

Now we define a matrix with entries
\[a_{G,\{u,v\}}:=\begin{cases}1&E_G(u,v)\\0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]
where the rows are indexed by one of $\abs{\mathcal{G}_k}$ many graphs in $\mathcal{G}_k$ and the columns are indexed by the $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ many $2$-element sets of numbers in $k$. We take any distinct vertices $u,v$ and define $p:=\Pr_{G\in \mathcal{G}_k}[E_G(u,v)]=\frac{c_{u,v}}{\abs{\mathcal{G}_k}},$ by the claim the choice of $u,v$ does not matter.

The assumption from the statement is equivalent to the equality 
\[\sum_{\{u,v\}}a_{G,\{u,v\}}\leq \frac{k(k-1)}{2}b_k\] 
for every $G$. We combine this with the claim and the definition of $p$ to get
\begin{align}
\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\abs{\mathcal{G}_k}p&=\sum_{\{u,v\}}\sum_{G\in\mathcal{G}_k}a_{G,\{u,v\}}\\
&=\sum_{G\in\mathcal{G}_k}\sum_{\{u,v\}}a_{G,\{u,v\}}\\
&\leq \abs{\mathcal{G}_k}\frac{k(k-1)}{2}b_k
\end{align}
which implies
\[p\leq b_k.\]

Now let $k:=n$ and let $T\in F_{tree}$ be a tree of depth $n^{1/t}$ for some $t>\mathbb{N}$, where every leaf of $T$ is labeled by some edge. Walk down the tree $T$ from the root by answering negatively to every edge, this gives us a set $E_T$ of all edges $T$ inspected or outputed and $\abs{E_T}\leq n^{1/t}+1$.

Now we just need to prove that the probability $T$ find an edge is infinitesimally small. This is enough to prove the theorem, since the trees computing any two witnesses for $x$ and $y$ in the statement can be combined to construct $T$ and if any tree $T$ succeeds with only infinitesimally small probability, no random vertices can witness an edge on a set of non-zero measure.

We use the fact that $p\leq b_n$ to derive 
\begin{align}
\Pr_{G\in\mathcal{G}_n}[T\text{ finds an edge}]&\leq \sum_{\{u,v\}\in E_T} \Pr_{G\in \mathcal{G}_n}[E_G(u,v)]\\
&=\sum_{\{u,v\}\in E_T} \frac{c_{u,v}}{\abs{\mathcal{G}_n}}\\
&\leq\sum_{\{u,v\}\in E_T} p\\
&=(n^{1/t}+1)p\\
&\leq(n^{1/t}+1)b_k\\
&\leq n^{1/k_0}b_k\\
&\approx 0,
\end{align}
which proves the theorem.
\end{proof}

The assumption $\lim_{k\to \infty} k^{1/k_0}b_k=0$ for some $k_0$ may seem unintuitive at first. However, it precisely reflects what is ``sparse" for the trees in $T_{tree}$. The following example shows that without the assumption the theorem fails.

\begin{exam}\label{examsparseedge}
Let $\mathcal{G}_k$ consist of all graphs on the vertex set $\set{k}$ with precisely $\lceil\frac{k(k-1)}{2\log k}\rceil$ edges.

Then we claim that
\[\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\Gamma(x,y)\bbr=\1.\]

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be verticies computed by the tree of the same shape which inspects a set of any $n^{1/t}$ distinct edges for some $t>\mathbb{N}$. If it finds an edge we define $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in any way so they are the distinct verticies incidental with this edge. Otherwise we let $\alpha(\omega)=\beta(\omega)=0$.

Let $T$ be a tree of the same shape, that computes the pair $\{\alpha,\beta\}$ then we can compute the probability where such a tree fails as the fraction of all graphs which have no edges that $T$ inspects. Let $m=\binom{n}{2}$. We get

\begin{align}
\Pr_{G\in\mathbb{G}_n}[T\text{ fails}]&=\frac{\binom{m-n^{1/t}}{\ceil{ \frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}} }}{\binom{m}{\ceil{ \frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}}}}\\
&=\frac{\frac{(m-n^{1/t})!}{\ceil{\frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}} ! (m-\ceil{ \frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}}-n^{1/t})!}}{\frac{m!}{\lceil \frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}\rceil!(m-\ceil{\frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}})!}}\\
&=\frac{(m-n^{1/t})!(m-\ceil{ \frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}})!}{m!(m-\ceil{\frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}}-n^{1/t})!}\\
&=\prod_{i=0}^{n^{1/t}-1}\frac{m-\ceil{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}-i}{m-i}\\
&=\left(1-\frac{\ceil{\frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}}}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\right)^{n^{1/t}}\\
&\leq\left(1-\frac{\ceil{\frac{n(n-1)}{2\log n}}}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\right)^{n^{1/t}}\\
&\leq\left(1-\frac{1}{\log n}\right)^{n^{1/t}}
\end{align}

And for any standard $k$ we have
\begin{align}
\left(1-\frac{1}{\log n}\right)^{n^{1/t}}&\leq\left(1-\frac{1}{\log n}\right)^{k\cdot \log n}\\
&\leq (e^{-\frac{1}{\ln 2}})^k.
\end{align}

So $\st(\Pr_{G\in\mathcal{G}_n}[T\text{ fails}])=0$ and we get 
\begin{align}
\mu(\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\Gamma(x,y)) \bbr &\geq \mu(\bbl \Gamma(\alpha,\beta)\bbr)\\
&=\st(1-\Pr_{G\in\mathbb{G}_n}[T\text{ fails}])\\
&=1.
\end{align}
\end{exam}

\section{Dense $\G_k$}

Let us now consider how the density of a specific kind of substructure in the wide sequence corresponds to that substructure existing in the wide limit. Let $\varphi(\overline x)$ be an $\{E\}$-formula determining the isomorphism type of $\overline x$, note that for a constant tuple $\overline \alpha\in F_{rud}$ (computed by trees of depth 0) we have
\[\mu(\bbl\varphi(\overline \alpha)\bbr)=\st(\Pr_{\omega\in\Omega}[\omega\models \varphi(\overline \alpha)]).\]

\begin{thrm}\label{thrmexists}
Let $F$ contain all constants, $\G_k$ be a wide sequence and let $(\forall \overline x)\varphi_0(\overline x)$ be an open $\{E\}$-formula such that
\[\lim_{k\to\infty}\Pr_{\substack{G\in\mathcal{G}_k\\\overline a \in \set{g_k}^l}}(G\models\varphi_0(\overline a))=p.\]
Then $\mu(\bbl(\exists x)\varphi_0(x)\bbr)\geq p.$
\end{thrm}

\begin{proof}
We define a matrix with components 
\[C_{G,\overline a}=\begin{cases}1&G\models\varphi_0(\overline a)\\0&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

By $\aleph_1$-saturation we have that
\[\st\left (\frac{1}{\abs{\G_n}g_k^l}\sum_{G\in\G_n}\sum_{\overline a \in \set{g_k}^l}C_{G,\overline \alpha}\right )=1.\]

We claim that there is one $\overline a$ such that $\st(\Pr_{G\in\G_k}(G\models\varphi_0(\overline a)))=1$. Assume for contradiction, that for all $\overline a$ we have $\frac{1}{\abs{\G_n}}\sum_{G\in \G_n}\leq p$ for some $q<p$. Then
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\abs{\G_n}g_k^l}\sum_{G\in\G_n}\sum_{\overline a \in \set{g_n}^l}C_{G,\overline \alpha}&=
\frac{1}{g_k^l}\sum_{\overline a\in\set{g_n}^l}\frac{1}{\abs{\G_n}}\sum_{G\in\G_n}C_{G,\overline \alpha}\\
&\leq q,
\end{align}
which is a contradiction after taking the standard part of each value.

Therefore there is a tuple $\overline a$ such that $\mu(\bbl\varphi_0(\overline\alpha)\bbr)\geq p$, let $\gamma_{\overline a}$ be the constant function $\omega \mapsto \overline \alpha$ in $F$ and
\begin{align}
\bbl\varphi\bbr&=\Lor_{\overline\alpha}\bbl\varphi_0(\overline\alpha)\bbr\\
&\geq \bbl\varphi_0(\overline \gamma_{\overline a})\bbr.
\end{align}
By taking $\mu$ of both sides we prove the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{exam}
Recall Example \ref{examsparseedge} it is not hard to notice that for a $\G_k$ which consists of graphs with exactly $\floor{\frac{k(k-1)}{2\log k}}$ edges we have
\[\lim_{k\to\infty}\Pr_{\substack{G\in \G_k}\\\overline (u,v) \in \set{k}^2}[\lnot E(u,v)]=1,\]
by the theorem it follows that we have
\[\lim_{F}\G_n\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\lnot E(x,y)\bbr=\1.\]
\end{exam}

We follow with a less straightforward use of the theorem.

\begin{exam}\label{examskhalf}
Consider
\begin{align*}
\SK_k^{1/2}&:=\{(\set{k},E);\text{$E$ has a clique of size $\floor{k/2}$}, \abs{E}=\abs{E_{K_{\floor{k/2}}}}\},
\end{align*}
a wide sequence of all graphs with exactly one $\floor{k/2}$ clique and no other edges. One can check that for any $\{E\}$-formula $\varphi_l(\overline x)$ stating that $\overline x$ form a clique of size $l$ we claim that 
\[\lim_{k\to\infty} \Pr_{\substack{G\in\SK_k^{1/2}\\\overline a \in \set{k}^l}}[G\models \varphi(\overline a)]\geq(1/2)^l,\]
first notice that we can compute the probability for fixed $\overline a$ because $\SK_k^{1/2}$ is isomorphism closed. So we have
\begin{align}
\Pr_{G\in\SK_k^{1/2}}[G\models \varphi_l(\overline a)]&=\frac{\binom{k-l}{\floor{k/2}-l}}{\binom{k}{\floor{k/2}}}\\
&=\prod_{i=0}^l\frac{k-\floor{k/2}-i}{k-i}\\
&=\prod_{i=0}^l\left(1-\frac{\floor{k/2}}{k-i}\right)\\
&\geq\prod_{i=0}^l\left(1-\frac{k/2}{k-i}+\frac{1}{k-i}\right)\\
&\geq\left(1-\frac{k/2}{k-l}\right)^l\\
&\geq\left(1-\frac{1}{2(1-l/k)}\right)^l,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\lim_{k\to\infty}1-l/k=1.
\end{align}

This proves that for any $F$ that contains all constants we have
\[\lim_{F}\SK_{n}^{1/2}\bbl(\exists \overline x)\varphi_l(\overline x)\bbr>\0.\]
\end{exam}

\begin{thrm}\label{thrmuni}
Let $F$ contain all constants, let $\G_k$ a wide sequence and let $\varphi_0(\overline x)$ be an open $\{E\}$-sentence, such that
\[\lim_{k\to\infty}\Pr_{G\in\mathcal{G}_k}(G\models\varphi)=1.\]

Then $\lim_F \G_n \bbl(\forall \overline x)\varphi_0(\overline x)\bbr=\1.$


\end{thrm}

\begin{proof}
We have that $\st(\Pr_{G\in\mathcal{G}_n}(G\models\varphi))=1$ and therefore $\bbl\varphi_0(\overline\alpha)\bbr=\1$ for each tuple $\overline\alpha$ in $F$. Therefore
\begin{align}
\bbl\varphi\bbr&=\Land_{\overline\alpha}\bbl\varphi_0(\overline\alpha)\bbr\\
&=\Land_{\overline\alpha}\1\\
&=\1.
\end{align}
\end{proof}

\begin{exam}
Let us define
\begin{align}
\G_k^{A}&:=\{(\set{k},E);\abs{E}=2\},\\
\G_k^{B}&:=\{(\set{k},E);\abs{E}=(k\cdot(k-1)/2)-3\},\\
\G_k&:=\G_k^{A}\cup\G_k^{B},
\end{align}
and let 
\[\varphi_0(a,b,c,d):=\left(\Land_{\substack{x, y\in\{a,b,c,d\}\\\text{$x,y$ distinct}}}(x\not=y)\right)\to\left(\Lor_{\substack{x, y\in\{a,b,c,d\}\\\text{$x,y$ distinct}}}E(x,y)\right),\]

Which says that if $a,b,c,d$ are distinct then there is an edge between one of them. The universal closure is valid on all graphs in $\G_k^B$ and none of the graphs in $\G_k^A$. Since $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}/\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{n-3}$ is infinitesimal we have that $\lim_{k\to\infty} \binom{\binom{k}{2}}{2}/\binom{\binom{k}{2}}{k-3}=0$ we have by Theorem \ref{thrmuni} that $\lim_F \G_n \bbl(\forall a,b,c,d)\varphi_0^\Gamma(a,b,c,d)\bbr=\1$ for any $F$ containing all constants.
\end{exam}

It is natural to ask whether we can weaken the assumption of Theorem \ref{thrmuni} to an assumption analogous to Theorem \ref{thrmexists}. In other words, is
\[\lim_{k\to\infty}\Pr_{\substack{G\in\G_k\\\overline a\in \set{g_k}^l}}[G\models\varphi_0(\overline a)]=1\]
enough to imply $\lim_F\G_n\bbl(\forall x)\varphi_0^\Gamma(\overline x)\bbr=\1$? Unfortunately no, as we can see in the following example.

\begin{exam}Recall Example \ref{examsparseedge} where $\G_k$ consists of all graphs on $\set{k}$ with exactly $\floor{\frac{k(k-2)}{2\log k}}$ edges. One can easily check that
\[\lim_{k\to\infty}\Pr_{\substack{G\in\G_k\\u,v \in \set{k}}}[G\models \lnot E(u,v)]=1,\]
but we proved that $\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n \bbl(\exists x,y)E(x,y)\bbr=\1$ in other words we have \[\lim_{F_{rud}}\bbl(\forall x,y)\lnot E(x,y)\bbr=\0.\]
\end{exam}

Now we return to $F=F_{rud}$ and prove a theorem with a more limited use which however forces the truth value of the existential sentence in the wide limit to be $\1$.

\begin{thrm}\label{mutindfind}
Let $F=F_{rud}$ and let $\varphi_0(x_0,\dots,x_{l-1})$ be an open $\{E\}$-formula. Furthermore for $0<p\leq 1$, consider subsets $A\subseteq\set{g_k}^l$ with the property that for all for all $\overline a \in A$ we have
\[\Pr_{G\in\mathcal{G}_k}(G\models \varphi_0(\overline a))\geq p\]
and
\[\text{$\{\{G\models\varphi_0(\overline a)\}\subseteq \mathcal{G}_k;\overline a \in A\}$ are mutually independent,}\]
moreover let $A_k$ be the set with the largest cardinality that  has this property.

If $\lim_{k\to\infty} \abs{A_k}=\infty$, then $\bbl(\exists \overline x)\varphi_0(\overline x)\bbr=\1$.
\end{thrm}

\begin{proof}
Let $\overline x = (x_0,\dots,x_{l-1})$. Let $T_{\overline a}$ be a tree of some standard depth $d$, that tests whether $G\models\varphi_0(\overline a)$.

From $\aleph_1$-saturation of $\mathcal{M}$ we have $n'>\mathbb{N}$ many tuples \(\overline a_0,\dots,\overline a_{n'-1}\in A_n\), such that \(\Pr_{G\in\mathcal{G}_k}(G\models\varphi_0(\overline a_i))\geq p\), we can assume $n'<n^{1/t_0}$ for some $t_0>\mathbb{N}$.


For $j\in[l]$ construct a tree $T_j$ inductively as follows: Start with $T_{\overline a_0}$. Replace the label of every accepting leaf by $(\overline a_0)_j$ and remove the label of every rejecting leaf. Call this tree $T_j^0$. Assume we have already constructed $T_j^{m}$. Construct $T_j^{i+1}$ by appending $T_{\overline a_{m+1}}$ to every undefined leaf, relabeling every satisfied leaf to $(\overline a_{i+1})_j$ and removing labels from every rejecting leaf. We will define $T_j$ as $T_j^{n'}$ with undefined leafs labeled by $0$. (This can be done, because all instances of induction are in $\Th(\mathbb{N})$.) Note that $\dpt(T_j)=d\cdot n' < n^{1/t}$ for some $t>\mathbb{N}$. 

Call $\overline \alpha$ the tuple computed by $T_0,\dots,T_{l-1}$. We will prove that probability of $\overline \alpha$ being a witness to $\varphi_0(\overline x)$ is 1. For each $\overline a_i$ we have, that the probability of $G\models\varphi_0(\overline a_i)$ is at least $p$. The mutual independence of ${\{G\models\varphi_0(\overline a_i);i\in[n']\}}$ and the construction of $T_j$ implies that $T_j$ has a probability of $(1-p)^{n'}$ of failing, which is obviously almost $0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exam}
Let \[\mathcal{G}_k=\{([k],E);\text{$E$ at least one edge, and may have exactly $k/2$ more from start}\}\]

and let $F=F_{tree}$. Then $\mu(\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\Gamma(x,y)\bbr)=\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{exam}

We now use this theorem to characterize the theory of another wide limit. We denote
\[\ALL_k=\{G \text{ undirected graph, }V_G=\set{k}\}.\]

Note that if we consider an open $\{E\}$-formula $\varphi(\overline x)$ and convert it to DNF we get a disjunction of conjuctions. Each such conjuction says which first order literals should be satisfied on the variables $\overline x$, the following theorem is proved for conjunctons of literals. By the fact that $\bbl\dots\bbr$ commutes with disjunctions, we can find out a value of any existential sentence.

\begin{thrm}[Everything exists]
Let $\varphi(\overline x,\overline y)=\Land_{i=0}^{m-1}\psi_i(\overline x,\overline y)\land \Land_{i=0}^{l-1}\vartheta_i(\overline y)$, where $\psi_i,\vartheta_i$ are literals and $\psi_i$ are not of the form $(y_i=y_j)^b$, $E(y_i,y_j)^b$, $x_i\not= x_i$, $E(x_i,x_i)$, $b\in\{0,1\}$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item each $\psi_i$ are not of the form $(y_i=y_j)^b,E(y_i,y_j)^b,x_i\not = x_i, E(x_i,x_i)$ for $b\in\{0,1\}$
\item if $\psi_i$ is of the form $(x_i=z)^b$ for $z$ in $\overline x$ or $\overline y$ then no other $\psi_j$ is of the form $(x_i=z)^{1-b}$ or $(z=x_i)^{1-b}$
\item if $\psi_i$ is of the form $E(x_i,z)^b$ for $z$ in $\overline x$ or $\overline y$ then no other $\psi_j$ is of the form $E(x_i,z)^{1-b}$ or $E(z,x_i)^{1-b}$.
\end{itemize}

If $\overline \beta$ is a tuple of vertices computed by $F_{tree}$ of the same length as $\overline y$ then \[\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n\bbl(\exists \overline x)\varphi^\Gamma(\overline x,\overline \beta)\bbr=\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n\bbl\Land_{i=0}^{l-1}\vartheta_i(\overline \beta)\bbr,\] specifically if $l=0$ then

\[\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n\bbl(\exists \overline x)\phi_0(\overline x,\overline \beta)\bbr=\1.\]
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof} We will construct one tree $T$ computing the whole tuple of witnesses $\overline \alpha$, such a construction can be straightforwardly split into a tuple of tree each computing the specific element.

First we concatenate all the trees used to compute $\overline \beta$. At each leave we can now proceed knowing the value of $\overline \beta$ at the specific $\omega\in\Omega$. Now we just construct a tree as in Theorem \ref{mutindfind} but searching only over edges not checked previously and only to fulfill each $\psi_i$. Luckily we have so far searched only an infinitesimal part of the edges and since we assume $\mathcal{G}_k=\text{ALL}_k$ both of the conditions of the theorem are satisfied, so by analogous argument, we have a tree that finds a witness all of the $\psi_i(\overline x,\overline \beta)$ with probability infinitesimally close to 1.

Therefore
\begin{align}
\bbl(\exists \overline x)\varphi^\Gamma(\overline x,\overline \beta)\bbr&=\bbl(\exists \overline x)\Land_{i=0}^{m-1}\psi_i(\overline x,\overline \beta)\bbr \land \bbl\Land_{i=0}^{l-1}\vartheta_i(\overline \beta)\bbr\\
&=\bbl\Land_{i=0}^{l-1}\vartheta_i(\overline \beta)\bbr.
\end{align}
\end{proof}

The statement of the theorem was rather technical, but we can now use it to prove a few corollaries.

\begin{crll}For each $\varphi(\overline x)$ that is not a contradiction in the theory of graphs we have that $\bbl(\exists \overline x)\varphi^\Gamma(\overline x)\bbr=1.$
\end{crll}
\begin{proof}
The conditions on $\psi_i$ are exactly saying that the conjunction is not a contradiction. Every other formula can be rewritten as a disjunction of such conjunctions and by the theorem we can satisfy at least one (in fact all of those which are not contradictions).
\end{proof}
\begin{crll}\label{crllev2}
For each $\varphi(\overline x,\overline y)$ that is not falsifiable by $\overline y$ in the theory of graphs we have that $\bbl(\forall \overline y)(\exists \overline x)\varphi^\Gamma(\overline x)\bbr=\1$.
\end{crll}
\begin{proof}
No $\overline \beta$ can falsify $(\exists \overline x)\varphi(\overline x,\overline \beta)$, this means we can invoke the theorem on one of the non-falsifiable conjuncts.
\end{proof}

\begin{thrm}
The theory \[\Th(\lim_{F_{rud}}\ALL_n)\] is the theory of the Rado graph and therefore complete.
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
In \cite{gaifman1964rado} it is proved that the theory of the Rado graph is axiomatized by the theory of undirected graphs and the sentences $E_{i,j}$ which say that if we have a set $A$ of $i$ distinct vertices and a set $B$ of $j$ distinct vertices such that $A\cap B=\varnothing$, then there is a vertex $v$ which has an edge with all vertices from $A$ and no vertices from $B$.

Each $E_{i,j}$ satisfies the statement of Corollary \ref{crllev2} and because it is also an complete theory we have proved the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{crll}(0-1 law for $\ALL_k$)
For every $\{E\}$-sentence $\varphi$ we have that
\[\lim_{F_{rud}}\ALL_n\bbl\varphi^\Gamma\bbr\in\{\0,\1\}.\]
\end{crll}


The wide sequence $\ALL_k$ is maximal in the sense that for every $\G_k$ with $g_k=k$ we have that $\G_{k}\subseteq \ALL_{k}$. Since we proved 0-1 law for $\ALL_k$ we can ask whether this tells us anything about the subobjects of $\ALL_k$ since they consist in some sense of all other wide sequences.

\begin{defi}
Let $\G_k$ be a wide sequence, we say that $\G_k'$ is a \textbf{portion} of $\G_k$ if we have $\G_k'\subseteq \G_k$ for all $k$ big enough which we denote $\G_k'\leq G_k$. We say it is a \textbf{large portion} if we have
\[p:=\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\abs{\G_k'}}{\abs{\G_k}}>0,\]
which we denote $\G_k' \leqp \G_k$.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemm}\label{lemmhere}
Let $\G_k'\leqp \G_k$ be wide sequence and let $\varphi$ be an $\{E\}$-sentence such that
\[\lim_{F}\G_n\bbl\varphi\bbr\in\{\0,\1\}\]
then
\[\lim_{F}\G_n'\bbl\varphi\bbr = \lim_{F}\G_n\bbl\varphi\bbr.\]
\end{lemm}
\begin{proof} 
Assume $\varphi$ is of the form $(\forall \overline x_1)(\exists \overline x_2)\dots (\exists \overline x_l)\varphi(\overline x_1,\dots,\overline x_l)$ so we have
\begin{align*}
\lim_{F}\G_n\bbl\varphi\bbr &= \Land_{\overline \alpha_1}\Lor_{\overline \alpha_2}\dots \Lor_{\overline \alpha_l}\lim_{F}\G_n\bbl\varphi(\overline \alpha_1,\dots,{\overline \alpha_l})\bbr\\
\lim_{F}\G_n'\bbl\varphi\bbr &= \Land_{\overline \alpha_1}\Lor_{\overline \alpha_2}\dots \Lor_{\overline \alpha_l}\lim_{F}\G_n'\bbl\varphi(\overline \alpha_1,\dots,{\overline \alpha_l})\bbr,
\end{align*}
so we just need to establish equality of the substituted open kernel.

Since $\G_n'$ is a large portion we have $p:=\lim_{k\to\infty}\abs{\G_n'}/\abs{\G_n}$. Denote an event
\[A_G:=[G\models \varphi^{\Gamma}(\overline\alpha_1(G),\dots\overline \alpha_l(G)],\]
we have that 
\begin{align}
\Pr_{G\in\G_n}[A_G]&=\Pr_{G\in \G_n}[A_G|G\in\G_n']\Pr_{G\in\G_n}[G\in\G_n']\\
&\phantom{\:=\:}+\Pr_{G\in\G_n}[A_G|G\in\G_n\setminus\G_n']\Pr_{G\in\G_n'}[G\in\G_n \setminus \G_n'].
\end{align}
If $\Pr_{G\in\G_n}[A_G]=1$ and $q:=\Pr_{G\in\G_n'}[A_G]<1$ we have by taking standard parts
\begin{align}
1&=p\cdot q + (1-p)\cdot q'\\
&< p + (1-p)\cdot q'\\
&\leq1,
\end{align}
a contradiction. The second case where $\lim_F\G_n\bbl\varphi\bbr=\0$ then follows from $\lim_F\G_n\bbl\lnot\varphi\bbr=\1.$ 
\end{proof}

In other words if $\G_n$ admits a 0-1 law, then all its large portions do and their theories are the same.

\begin{crll}\label{crlltoobig}
Let $\G_k$ be a wide sequence such that 
\[\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\abs{\G_k}}{2^{\binom{g_k}{2}}}>0\] then $\Th(\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n)$ is the theory of Rado graph.
\end{crll}
\begin{proof}
The condition on the limit assures that $\G_k\leqp \ALL_{g_k}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Isomorphism closed categorical $\mathcal{G}_k$}

Take a isomorphism closed wide sequence $\G_k$, what are its isomorphism closed portions? It turns out its easy to classify them, any such portion can be constructed as a union of those wide sequences which always one isomorphism type of each $\G_k$ and those precisely match the isomorphism closed sequences which satisfy the following property.

\begin{defi}\label{lemmisocat}
We say that $\{\mathcal{G}_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is \textbf{categorical} if there is $k_0$ such that for every $k>k_0$ if we have $G_1,G_2\in\mathcal{G}_k$ then $G_1\cong G_2$. For a categorical wide sequence $\{G_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ we denote $G_k$ the lexicographically minimal element of $\mathcal{G}_k$.
\end{defi}

One can see isomorphism closed $\G_k$ as the natural wide sequences and categorical isomorphism closed wide sequences as their building blocks. The concept of isomorphism closed categorical wide sequences can be already limiting the form of the sequence. We have the following lemma which limits sizes of $\G_k$ to specific values.

\begin{lemm}
Let $\{\mathcal{G}_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ be categorical and isomorphism closed, then for large enough $k$
\[\abs{\mathcal{G}_k}=\frac{g_k!}{\abs{\Aut(G_k)}}.\]
\end{lemm}
\begin{proof}
Every $\rho\in S_{g_k}$ defines an isomorphism $\rho:G_k\to\rho(G_k)$, where $\rho(G_k)$ is a graph obtained from $G_k$ by renaming every vertex $v$ to $\rho(v)$.

{}
\textbf{Claim:} For any $\rho,\pi\in S_{g_k}$:
\[\rho(G_k)=\pi(G_k)\iff\exists \tau\in\Aut(G_k):\rho\circ\tau=\pi.\]
\textit{Proof of claim.} ``$\Rightarrow$" Let $\rho(G_k)=\pi(G_k)$, therefore $\tau:=\rho^{-1}\circ\pi\in\Aut(G_k)$ and $\rho\circ\tau=\rho\circ\rho^{-1}\circ\pi=\pi.$

``$\Leftarrow$" Let $\rho\circ\tau=\pi$. Then $\pi(G_k)=\rho(\tau(G_k))=\rho(G_k).$ \qedhere

Notice that the $\tau$ in the statement of the claim is uniquely determinted by $\rho^{-1}\circ\pi$. Therefore if we defined a quotient set $S_{g_k}/\sim$ with $\rho\sim\pi\iff\rho(G_k)=\pi(G_k)$ then $\abs{S_{g_k}/\sim}=\frac{g_k!}{\abs{\Aut(G_k)}}$.

The Lemma follows from noticing that if we start with $\{G_k\}$ and then we build $\mathcal{G}_k$ by finding isomorphic graphs on the vertex set $[g_k]$ we can only do so by trying different permutation from $S_{g_k}$ and these permutations find the same graph if and only if they are in the same $\sim$-class. Therefore there is a bijection between $S_{g_k}/\sim$ and $\mathcal{G}_k$. \qed
\end{proof}

So far we did not encounter an isomorphism closed wide sequence $\G_k$ and a $\{E\}$-sentence $\varphi$ such that $\0<\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n\bbl\varphi^\Gamma\bbr<\1$. One can use isomorphism closed categorical wide sequences to construct such a wide sequence.
\begin{exam}
Let
\begin{align}
\nEDGE_k&:=\{(\set{k},E);\abs{E}=(k(k-1)/2)-1\}\\
\G_k&:=\EDGE_k\cup\nEDGE_k,
\end{align}

Then one can see that $\mu(\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n\bbl(\exists x)(\exists y)\Gamma(x,y)\bbr)=\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{exam}

However each $\EDGE_k$ and $\nEDGE_k$ have complete theories. So natural follow up to this question whether 0-1 law holds for all isomorphism closed categorical wide sequences. 

Theorem \ref{thrmsparse}, Corollary \ref{crlltoobig} and Lemma \ref{lemmisocat} already give some conditions on what any counterexample would have to satisfy. However we did not find any nor did we rule out its existance. 

\begin{ques}
Is there a isomorphism closed categorical wide sequence $\G_k$ and an $\{E\}$-sentence $\varphi$ such that
\[\0<\lim_{F_{rud}}\G_n\bbl\varphi^\Gamma\bbr<\1?\]
\end{ques}
