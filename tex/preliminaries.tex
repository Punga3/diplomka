In this chapter we recall a few important notions which we will use in the next chapter to define the central construction we study. We do not review the notions formally but always provide a reference for the reader unfamiliar with these topics. Throughout this thesis we assume a basic knowledge of mathematical logic, model theory and measure theory. Important concept for us are the nonstandard models of true arithmetic. 

\section*{The ambient model $\M$}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The ambient model $\M$}

We call a model of $\Th(\N)$ nonstandard if it is not isomorphic to $\N$. Every model of $\Th(\N)$ of course contains an initial segment isomorphic to $\N$ so we can view nonstandard models as those which also contain `infinite natural numbers', if we assume $\M\models \Th(\N)$ contains $\N$ as an initial segment then the elements $\M\setminus \N$ are called nonstandard. We recommend the introduction of \cite{kaye1991pa} for a review of this topic. In the appendix of \cite{krajicek2010forcing} there is an explicting ultraproduct construction of a model $\M\models \Th(\N)$ which is $\aleph_1$-saturated.

This $\aleph_1$-saturated model $\M$ is used throughout this thesis and we call it the ambient model of arithmetic. For our applications we just need to know that the model is nonstandard and the following property holds because of the $\aleph_1$-saturation.

\begin{prope}
If $\{a_k\}_{k\geq 0}$ is a sequence with elements in $\N$ then there is an element $t\in \M \setminus \N$ and a sequence $\{b_k\}_{k<t}\in \M$ with $a_k=b_k$ for all $k\in \N$.
\end{prope}

By overspill in $\M$ if some definable property $P$ holds for any $a_k$ with high enough index then there is also some nonstandard $s<t$ such that $b_s$ satisfies the property $P$.

\section*{Nonstandard analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Nonstandard analysis}

The reader can refer to \cite{goldbring2014lecture} for more formal treatment of topics discussed in this section including proofs. To use the method of forcing with random variables we need to consider the concept of so-called $\M$-rationals. To define them we start by simply adjoining all negative elements to the semiring $\M$ to obtain the integral domain $\overline \M$. $\M$-rationals are then simply the ordered field of fractions $\Frac(\overline \M)$ which we denote $\Q^\M$.

There is a canonical injection $\Q \xhookrightarrow{} \Q^\M$ whose image consist exactly of the `standard fractions'. We call a $q\in\Q^\M$ finite if there is a standard $k$ such that $\abs{q}<\frac{k}{1}$ otherwise we call it infinite. We call $q\in\Q^\M$ infinitesimal if $q$ is infinite. One can check that $\Q^\M$ fulfills the axioms of hyperreal numbers which can be used as an alternative foundation to the concepts of mathematical analysis. This implies that there is a canonical injection $\R\hookrightarrow \Q^\M$ of ordered fields. The following is an important result which we use throughout the thesis.

\begin{thrm*}
Let $q\in\Q^\M$ finite. Then there exist unique $r\in \R$ and an infinitesimal $m\in\Q^\M$ such that
$q=r+m.$

We use the notation $\st(q):=r$ and call $r$ it the \textbf{standard part of} $q$.
\end{thrm*}

The following result characterizes convergence of a sequence of rational numbers in the language of nonstandard analysis.

\begin{thrm*}
Let $\{c_k\}_{k\geq 0}$ be a sequence of rational numbers. Then \[\lim_{k\to\infty}c_k = r \in \R\]
if and only if for any nonstandard $n\in \M$ we have that
$\st(c_n)=r.$
\end{thrm*}

We close this section with two inequalities heavily used in the proofs throughout the thesis.

\begin{thrm*}[Bernoulli's inequality]
Let $y \in \M$ and $x\in \Q^\M, x\geq -1$, then
\[(1+x)^y \geq 1+yx.\]
\end{thrm*}

\begin{thrm*}[Exponential inequality]
Let $y \in \M$ and $x\in \Q^\M, x\geq 0$, then
\[\left(1-\frac{x}{y}\right)^y \leq e^{-x}.\]
\end{thrm*}

\section*{Total $\NP$ search problems and polynomial oracle time}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Total $\NP$ search problems and polynomial oracle time}

Our goal is to tie the properties of the wide limit with some complexity theoretic statements. We will recall several notions used later on.

The class of total $\NP$ search problems $\TFNP$, first defined in \cite{megiddo1991total}, consist of all relations on binary strings $P(x,y)$ such that: a) There is a polynomial time machine $M$ which, given $x,y$, can decide whether $P(x,y)$ holds. b) For every $x$ there exists at least one $y$ which is at most polynomially longer than $x$ such that $P(x,y)$ holds.

While the definition of the class $\TFNP$ seems natural, the inner structure looks more arbitrary and the class is generally studied through its semantic subclasses. For example it is conjectured that there is no complete problem for $\TFNP$ \cite{goldberg2018tfnp}.

The semantic subclasses are defined as all problems reducible to some problem corresponding to a combinatorial lemma, for some appropriate definition of `reduction'. Two main subclasses are relevant for us. The class $\PPA$, polynomial parity argument, corresponds to all problems reducible to $\LEAF$, the problem formulated as follows. Given a graph $G$ on the vertex set $\set{k}$ such that $\deg_G(0)=1$ and $\forall v: \deg_G(v)\leq 2$, find some nonzero $v$ with $\deg_G(v)=2$. The corresponding combinatorial principle being the handshaking lemma, which assures the problem is total. And the class $\PPAD$, directed polynomial parity argument, with the complete problem $\SOURCEORSINK$ formulated as follows. Given a directed graph $G$ on the vertex set $\set{k}$ such that the vertex $0$ is a source and $\forall v: \deg_G^+(v),\deg_G^-(v)\leq 1$ find some nonzero vertex $v$ which is a source or a sink. The corresponding combinatorial principle here being the directed version of the handshaking lemma.

So far, we presented what is called `type 1' problem in \cite{beame1995rel}. The ones we are interested in are `type 2' problems which replace the input graph $G$ with a pair $(\alpha,x)$ an oracle $\alpha$ describing the neighbourhood function $N_G(-)$ (or both $N_G^+(-)$ and $N_G^-(-)$ in the directed case) on binary string of length at most $\abs{x}$. While the goal to solve these problems remains the same, suddenly the situation is quite different, the graphs given by oracles are exponential in size and thus easily separated from $\FP^2$, the type 2 version of polynomial time functions. More importantly we have that $\PPAD\subsetneq \PPA$ as type 2 complexity classes. Intuitively one can forget the orientation to get the undirected version, but cannot consistently assign orientation to an undirected edges of a large graph.

The traditional model of computation are the Turing machines and for the type 2 problems oracle Turing machines. But to prove separations in the type 2 case, we can abstract the computation of an oracle Turing machine into a decision tree which describes the queries to an oracle. This is
